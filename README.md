# vibe-camp
Welcome to Vibe Coding Camp!

This project is a workshop to teach a new developer how to vibe-code.

It might be useful to you if you want to learn the same.

This project is currently "alpha" and not ready for others to use just yet.

I hope you learn something cool from this!

Usage:

uv run app/detect_objects.py

curl -X POST http://localhost:8487/upload -F "file=@./IMG_0280.jpg;type=image/jpeg"
